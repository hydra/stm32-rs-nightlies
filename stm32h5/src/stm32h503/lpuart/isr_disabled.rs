It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the NFCF bit in the LPUART_ICR register. Note: This bit does not generate an interrupt as it appears at the same time as the RXNE/RXFNE bit which itself generates an interrupt.

///Field `RWU` reader - Receiver wakeup from Mute mode This bit indicates if the LPUART is in Mute mode. It is cleared/set by hardware when a wakeup/mute sequence is recognized. The Mute mode control sequence (address or IDLE) is selected by the WAKE bit in the LPUART_CR1 register.
