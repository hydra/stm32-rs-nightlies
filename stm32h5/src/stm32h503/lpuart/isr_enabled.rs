It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the NFCF bit in the LPUART_ICR register. Note: This bit does not generate an interrupt as it appears at the same time as the RXFNE bit which itself generates an interrupt. An interrupt is generated when the NE flag is set during multi buffer communication if the EIE bit is set. This error is associated with the character in the LPUART_RDR.

///Field `TC` reader - Transmission complete This bit indicates that the last data written in the LPUART_TDR has been transmitted out of the shift register.

When TDN is equal to the number of data in the TXFIFO, the TC flag is set when TXFIFO is empty and TDN is reached. When TDN is greater than the number of data in the TXFIFO, TC remains cleared until the TXFIFO is filled again to reach the programmed number of data to be transferred. When TDN is less than the number of data in the TXFIFO, TC is set when TDN is reached even if the TXFIFO is not empty. An interrupt is generated if TCIE=1 in the LPUART_CR1 register.

This flag remains set until the TXFIFO is full. When the TXFIFO is full, this flag is cleared indicating that data can not be written into the LPUART_TDR. The TXFNF is kept reset during the flush request until TXFIFO is empty. After sending the flush request (by setting TXFRQ bit), the flag TXFNF should be checked prior to writing in TXFIFO (TXFNF and TXFE are set at the same time). An interrupt is generated if the TXFNFIE bit =1 in the LPUART_CR1 register. Note: This bit is used during single buffer transmission.

When wakeup on IDLE mode is selected, this bit can only be set by software, writing 1 to the MMRQ bit in the LPUART_RQR register.
