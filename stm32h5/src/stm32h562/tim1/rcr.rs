///Field `REP` reader - Repetition counter reload value This bitfield defines the update rate of the compare registers (i.e. periodic transfers from preload to active registers) when preload registers are enable. It also defines the update interrupt generation rate, if this interrupt is enable. When the repetition down-counter reaches zero, an update event is generated and it restarts counting from REP value.
