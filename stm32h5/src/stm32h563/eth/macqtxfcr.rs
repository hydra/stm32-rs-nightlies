Full-Duplex mode: this bit should be read as 0 before writing to this register. To initiate a Pause packet, the application must set this bit to 1. During Control packet transfer, this bit continues to be set to indicate that a packet transmission is in progress. When Pause packet transmission is complete, the MAC resets this bit to 0.

During backpressure, when the MAC receives a new packet, the transmitter starts sending a JAM pattern resulting in a collision.
