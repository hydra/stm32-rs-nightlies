For example, if the transmitter defers for 10,000 bit times because the CRS signal is active and the CRS signal becomes inactive, the transmitter transmits and collision happens. Because of collision, the transmitter needs to back off and then defer again after back off completion. In such a scenario, the deferral timer is reset to 0, and it is restarted.
