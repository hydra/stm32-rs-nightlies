///Field `PPSCMD` reader - Flexible PPS Output (eth_ptp_pps_out) Control Programming these bits with a non-zero value instructs the MAC to initiate an event. When the command is transferred or synchronized to the PTP clock domain, these bits get cleared automatically. The software should ensure that these bits are programmed only when they are ‘all zero’. The following list describes the values of PPSCMD0: This command generates single pulse rising at the start point defined in Target Time Registers (register 455 and 456) and of a duration defined in the PPS Width Register. This command generates the train of pulses rising at the start point defined in the Target Time Registers and of a duration defined in the PPS Width Register and repeated at interval defined in the PPS Interval Register.
