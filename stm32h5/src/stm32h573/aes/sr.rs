It is cleared by software upon setting the RWEIF bit of the AES_ICR register. Upon the flag setting, an interrupt is generated if enabled through the RWEIE bit of the AES_ICR register. The flag setting has no impact on the AES operation. Unexpected read returns zero.

///Field `BUSY` reader - Busy This flag indicates whether AES is idle or busy during GCM payload encryption phase: When the flag indicates “idle”, the current GCM encryption processing may be suspended to process a higher-priority message. In other chaining modes, or in GCM phases other than payload encryption, the flag must be ignored for the suspend process. The flag is set when transferring a shared key from SAES peripheral.

In normal mode when KEYSEL equals to zero, the application must write the key registers in the correct sequence, otherwise the KEIF flag of the AES_ISR register is set and KEYVALID stays at zero. When KEYSEL is different from zero the BUSY flag is automatically set by AES. When key is loaded successfully, the BUSY flag is cleared and KEYVALID set. Upon an error, the KEIF flag of the AES_ISR register is set, the BUSY flag cleared and KEYVALID kept at zero.
