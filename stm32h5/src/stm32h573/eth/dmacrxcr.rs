///Field `SR` reader - Start or Stop Receive When this bit is set, the DMA tries to acquire the descriptor from the Receive list and processes the incoming packets. The DMA tries to acquire descriptor from either of the following positions: The current position in the list: this is the address set by the Channel Rx descriptor list address register (ETH_DMACRXDLAR). The position at which the Rx process was previously stopped If the DMA does not own the current descriptor, the reception is suspended and the RBU bit of the ETH_DMACSR is set. The Start Receive command is effective only when the reception is stopped. If the command is issued before setting the Channel Rx descriptor list address register (ETH_DMACRXDLAR), the DMA behavior is unpredictable. When this bit is reset, the Rx DMA operation is stopped after the transfer of the current packet. The next descriptor position in the Receive list is saved, and it becomes the current position after the Rx process is restarted. The Stop Receive command is effective only when the Rx process is in the Running (waiting for Rx packet) or Suspended state.
